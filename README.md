chatbot created with the help of satvik and the fast build with ai team, the original project (I put the link here: https://github.com/satvik314/basic_chat_template.git) I modified it by adding a language change in Italian, Spanish and German. the chatbot keeps in memory the first 3 questions that the user asks it.

# üó£Ô∏è Conversational Chatbot with Streamlit and LangChain

This project demonstrates a simple chat interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs) using Streamlit and LangChain. It allows you to engage in natural conversations with LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo or Google's Gemini-pro.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satvik314/basic_chat_template.git
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd basic_chat_template
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Set up your API keys:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual API keys:

     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```

   - **Note:** Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of your API keys.

## Running the App

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the chat interface.**

## Usage

1. **Type your questions or prompts in the chat input field.**
2. **The chatbot will respond based on the selected LLM and your previous interactions.**
3. **You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions or providing new prompts.**

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive chat interface:** Streamlit provides a user-friendly way to interact with the chatbot.
